 * AGC Reference Level Configuration
 * Bit  Name                    Reset   R/W
 * 7:0  AGC_REFERNCE[7:0]       0x36    R/W
 *
 *      AGC reference level.
 *      The AGC reference level must be higher than the minimum SNR to the demodulator.
 *      The AGC reduces the analog front end gain when the magnitude output from
 *      channel filter > AGC reference level.
 *      An optimum AGC reference level is given by several conditions, but a rule of thumb
 *      is to use the formula:
 *
 *      AGC _ REFERENCE 10 log10 (RX Filter BW) 106 RSSI Offset
 *
 *      RX filter BW 10 kHz AGC_REFERENCE
 *       10 kHz      0x24 MDMCFG1.DVGAIN = 11, RSSI offset ~ -102 dB
 *       20 kHz      0x27 MDMCFG1.DVGAIN = 11, RSSI offset ~ -102 dB
 *       50 kHz      0x2b MDMCFG1.DVGAIN = 11, RSSI offset ~ -102 dB
 *      200 kHz      0x2b MDMCFG1.DVGAIN = 11, RSSI offset ~ -102 dB
 *      For zero-IF configuration, AGC hysteresis > 3 dB,
 *      or modem format which needs SNR > 15 dB,
 *      a higher AGC reference value is needed

 *
 *      CHAN_BW.CHFILT_BYPASS = 1
 *      fcutoff = ASK BW ScaleFactor * RXFilterBW [Hz]
